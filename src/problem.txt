To increase the file watchers limit we need to do certain things, first
enter the following command in your terminal

cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches

You might get output like this some integer.
8192

Now increase the limit by entering the next command

echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf

The above command will set your file watcher limit to 524288. To see whether it is set or not, type

sudo sysctl -p

output
fs.inotify.max_user_watches = 524288
